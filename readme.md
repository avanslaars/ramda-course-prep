# Ramda Course Prep

This repo is for experimenting with code samples and lessons to be turned into a cohesive course on Ramda for egghead.io. This course will replace the one-off Ramda lessons currently on the site.

## Key topics to cover

- [ ] curried functions
- [ ] function arity
- [ ] data last argument order
- [ ] function composition
- [ ] select Ramda functions in useful combinations
- [ ] lenses

## Delivery

Examples will mostly (completely?) exist as functions exported from individual modules with unit tests. The module(s) and test(s) will reside in individual lesson folders. If a module needs to exist for multiple lessons, it will be copied to keep each lesson independent. Jest will be used as the execution context, with wallaby/quokka running to allow easy inspection of output without having to run code via terminal or browser.
